    <title>Welcome Aboard</title>

    <h3>Hello!!!!</h3>
    <p>Hi there chief, welcome aboard</p>
    <p>The entire team at Adikastakes are really happy to have you join us</p>
    <p>When I started Adikastakes, I initially just wanted to share my takes on football, nothing more and nothing less.</p>
    <p>Overtime, with the support and love I got from you guys it's grown into more than just a place where I share my football takes. Overtime, I realized that it was so much more. The love, support, and ..... I'm already so emotional that I've teared up.</p>
    <p>But, one thing I can say is that Adikastakes is not just "Adika" but all of you who have come together to make it work.</p>
    <p>With that, I'd like to say we have officially launched our website. Feel free to shop for all of your sports needs and if you can't afford it, you can simply make a wish and add that dream product to your wishlist and you might be lucky to have your wish granted.</p>
    <p>Well then I guess that wraps it up.</p>
    <p>I love you guys so much, thanks for making this possible.</p>

    <p><i><b>Warm Regards,</b></i></p>
    <p><i><b>The Adikastakes Team</b></i></p>
